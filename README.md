# Hi! 👋 I'm Piet-Hein Schouten, Full Stack Web Developer 💻  


## 🚀 About Me  

Passionate about **technology** and **innovative software**, I enjoy combining creativity and technical skills to build impactful solutions that improve everyday life. My journey in tech started with a curiosity for how digital tools can connect people and ideas, which eventually led me to pursue full-stack development.  

I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute to meaningful projects and continuously learn new technologies. Whether it's building intuitive applications, optimizing performance, or experimenting with creative designs, I love taking on challenges that push my limits.  

When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, enjoying a football match, or brainstorming ideas for my next project.
