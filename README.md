# Hi👋, I'm Piet-Hein, Full Stack Web Developer 💻  


## About Me  


My whole life, I have been passionate about technology and software. Starting out as a entrepeneurship & retail management student, I realized I wanted to make a change and pursue a career in software development. Following my passion, I am now a Full Stack Developer. For me, building software feels like creating magic!

I am especially interested in working on meaningful projects that improve our daily lives. I enjoy building applications, websites, and games, optimizing performance, and experimenting with creative designs.

When I’m not coding, I explore new tech trends 🧑🏻‍💻, enjoy a football match ⚽️, or brainstorm ideas 💡 for my next project!
